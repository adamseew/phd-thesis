\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

%\lettrine{A}{a}

I am obliged to my advisor Prof. Ulrik Pagh Schultz for his encouragement, patience, and helpful discussions. He was always ready with a very thorough list of insightful suggestions and improvements. My gratitude goes also to my co-advisors, Dr. H\'ector Garc\'ia de Marina, who proposed the direction of this work, and Dr. Henrik Skov Midtiby, who shaped the outcomes.

Parts of this work are a result of collaborative efforts. I am indebted to Julius Roeder, Dr. Benjamin Rouxel, and Dr. Clemens Grelck from the Parallel Computing Systems group at the University of Amsterdam and to my colleagues, past and present, from the Unmanned Aerial Systems group at the University of Southern Denmark. I am additionally grateful to TeamPlay project consortium members for stimulating debates on low power computing during various occasions.

Finally, I wish to thank my mother and maternal grandparents who were of great support and indulgence.
